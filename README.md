In this app, I want to test Turbo Refresh + View Transitions.

Pain point: I love the idea of Turbo Refresh and how much spaghetti code it can eliminate, but I miss animating elements in/out when they are added/removed from the DOM.

Research indicates that the community is gravitating towards the browser View Transitions API to solve this. Would you agree?

In this app, I want you to demonstrate how that would work.

- Create a simple Todos app: Users, Lists, Items.
- Use Turbo Refresh for all Ajax.
- Use View Transitions to animate the items in/out when they are created/deleted.

Any questions?
